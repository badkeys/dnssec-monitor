Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to report a security issue.

A DNSSEC key configured for {{hostname}} is insecure.

{% if keyurl is not none -%}
You can find the private hey here:
  {{keyurl}}
{% endif %}

I would suggest that you replace this key with a fresh one or remove the
DNS record if it is unused.

This was discovered with the badkeys tool.

Yours faithfully,
